            <p>
              LZ is a product, design, and development consulting agency where I worked for 5 years. The projects we worked on were for (up to) Fortune 10 companies. I contributed with ux, visual, and animation design of our main website and on client projects. I was the go to designer for interactive/realistic, high-fidelity prototypes.

              A client requested the visual and ux designs for building space

              in their tool (unfortunately cannot list the names here). The
              software is a virtual tool to help companies choose a building
              that would work for their needs. I assisted by streamlining the
              the design system and animation behaviors in Framer X.

              We built warehouse software for a company that wanted to speed up

              visual design and behavior. I also handled all the the animation

            I am a UX designer and developer in San Francisco, currently doing consulting and freelance projects. My previous full time position was with Lab Zero. The clients there are large, house-hold name companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            My undergraduate degree is in design and computer science (Purdue
            University). To brush up on the latest technologies and to get more
            experience in the latest Javascript technologies I have attended and completed a fullstack javascript bootcamp for software engineering at Treehouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or designing, I love to take my dog on hikes
            around the bay area, see the latest sci-fi movies, play guitar, and
            practice yoga.
